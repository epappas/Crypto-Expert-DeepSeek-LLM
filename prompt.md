Act as an AI and data engineer and help me generate data to fine tune my deepSeek R1 LLM, in order to create a crypto recommendation engine bot. I need the bot to be able to discuss, advise and consult the user. It needs to have DeFi, economics but also DeFi software engineering fine tuned knowledge. Can you help me with creating the appropriate SFT samples? 

Use the `<think>/<answer>` format from DeepSeek-R1, but adapt it for crypto expertise. 

```
{
  "prompt": "[User Query]",
  "response": "<think> [Step-by-step reasoning] </think> <answer> [Final Answer] </answer>"
}
```

Example:

```
{
  "prompt": "Solve for x: √(a − √(a + x)) = x",
  "response": "<think> Let’s square both sides... </think> <answer> \boxed{0} </answer>"
}
```

Example personas:

- DeFi Advisory. Goal: Explain protocols, compare strategies, assess risks.

```
{
  "prompt": "What’s the safest way to provide liquidity on Uniswap V3 with minimal impermanent loss?",
  "response": "<think> 
  1. Uniswap V3 allows concentrated liquidity. 
  2. Impermanent loss (IL) depends on price volatility and range width. 
  3. Narrow ranges increase fees but also IL risk. 
  4. Mitigation: Use stablecoin pairs (e.g., USDC/DAI) or set a wide range during high volatility.
  </think> 
  <answer> 
  To minimize impermanent loss, provide liquidity in stablecoin pairs (e.g., USDC/DAI) with a wide price range. For volatile assets, use a range covering >50% of expected price movement. Monitor and rebalance quarterly.
  </answer>"
}
```

- Economics & Market Analysis. Goal: Explain tokenomics, predict trends, analyze risks.

```
{
  "prompt": "How will the Ethereum ETF approval impact ETH’s price and DeFi adoption?",
  "response": "<think> 
  1. ETFs increase institutional investment. 
  2. Historical analogy: Bitcoin ETF boosted BTC’s liquidity. 
  3. ETH price may surge short-term but stabilize as supply adjusts. 
  4. DeFi adoption grows as institutions use ETH for collateral.
  </think> 
  <answer> 
  The Ethereum ETF will likely cause a short-term price surge (20-30%) due to institutional demand, followed by stabilization. Long-term, it accelerates DeFi adoption by legitimizing ETH as collateral. Monitor staking yields post-ETF.
  </answer>"
}
```

- DeFi Software Engineering. Goal: Debug code, explain best practices, audit smart contracts.

```
{
  "prompt": "How do I prevent reentrancy attacks in my Solidity yield farming contract?",
  "response": "<think> 
  1. Reentrancy occurs when external calls hijack control flow. 
  2. Solution: Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. 
  3. Implement OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard. 
  4. Test with tools like Slither.
  </think> 
  <answer> 
  Add `nonReentrant` modifiers from OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard. Structure functions to update state variables before external calls. Example:
  ```solidity
  function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");
  }
  </answer>"
}
```

Data Sources:

- Web Scraping:
  Scrape DeFi forums (Reddit’s r/defi, StackExchange) and GitHub repositories for real-world Q&A.
  Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract threads and convert them into SFT format.

- Synthetic Data from Whitepapers:
  Convert sections from DeFi whitepapers (Uniswap, Compound) into Q&A pairs.
  Example:
    Prompt: "How does Uniswap V3’s concentrated liquidity work?"
    Response: Extract explanation from the whitepaper + add <think> reasoning.

Data Validation & Filtering

- Rule-Based Checks:
  Ensure <answer> includes code snippets for engineering questions.
  Validate numerical accuracy (e.g., APY formulas, tokenomics).
  ```
  def validate_math_response(response):
    if "APY" in response:
        assert "compound interest formula" in response.lower()
  ```

- Expert Review:
  Have a DeFi engineer review 5-10% of samples for technical accuracy.
  Use tools like Slither or MythX to verify code snippets in answers.

- Diversity Filtering:
  Balance topics: 40% DeFi, 30% Economics, 30% Software Engineering.
  Include non-English queries (e.g., Chinese users asking about Asian regulations).

more examples:

```jsonl
{"prompt": "What factors should I consider when choosing a yield farming pool on Ethereum?", "response": "<think> 1. APY vs. risk tolerance. 2. Smart contract audit status. 3. Pool longevity. 4. Token pair volatility. 5. Gas fees for entry/exit. </think> <answer> Prioritize audited pools with >6 months history and stablecoin pairs. Check DeFiLlama for APY trends and always calculate net returns after gas costs.</answer>"}
{"prompt": "How does the Federal Reserve's interest rate affect Bitcoin prices?", "response": "<think> 1. Rate hikes strengthen USD. 2. BTC often inversely correlates with USD. 3. Investors may shift to risk-off assets. 4. Historical 2022-2023 rate hikes saw BTC drop 60%. </think> <answer> Rising rates typically pressure BTC prices short-term. Monitor Fed announcements and CME BTC futures for institutional sentiment signals.</answer>"}
{"prompt": "Design a cross-margin trading system using EIP-4626 vaults as collateral.", "response": "<think> 1. Risk engine. 2. Liquidation triggers. 3. Margin efficiency. 4. Vault shares as collateral. </think> <answer> Architecture:\n1. Deposit yvUSDC (EIP-4626) as collateral\n2. Compute risk-adjusted value: shares * price * LTV\n3. Liquidate if: Σ(collateral * LTV) < maintenance_margin\nCode:\n```solidity\nfunction canLiquidate(address user) public view returns (bool) {\n    uint total = 0;\n    for (IVault vault in collaterals[user]) {\n        uint shares = vault.balanceOf(user);\n        uint assets = vault.convertToAssets(shares);\n        total += assets * ltv[vault];\n    }\n    return total < positions[user].maintenanceMargin;\n}\n``` LTV ratios: 80% stablecoins, 50% ETH.</answer>"}
